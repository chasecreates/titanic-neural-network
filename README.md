## Synopsis

I'm rather new to deep learning, thought I'd take a stab at a Kaggle competition. Titanic datasets include information about the passenger
including their class, fare paid, age, siblings on board, parents on board, age, along with if they survived or not (denoted by a 0 or a 1).

Data was cleaned using Pandas (converting descriptive information to symbolic numerical data). A simple multilayer perceptron model was written
in Python using the Theano/Keras library. An accuracy of ~80% was obtained.
